# Hi there 👋 And welcome to my profile page! 🙌

I've started my journey in IT 💻 and this GitHub account in February 2021, when I started She Goes Tech - JavaScript bootcamp. So in my repositories you will be able to see what I was learning 👩‍🎓 , what kind of tasks etc., starting with plaing HTML/CSS/JavaScript and then continuing with Node, React and other things.

After starting to work in Accenture Baltics, I started to add here some repos from my continios learning, including more on JavaScript/React/Node, and also other things like C++, SQL etc. You won't see much of original code, as most of the time I'm working in private repos and different platforms, but I will try to continue on my latest idea of pet project - [Travel Plan Storage](https://github.com/merca3/travel-plan-storage), using NextJS full-stack framework for React. Wish me luck with that! 🍀
